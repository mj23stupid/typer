## 📖 What Is typer?

typer is a simple typing practice tool you can run in your computer’s terminal. It works like popular online typing tests but runs directly on your machine without a web browser. You improve your typing speed and accuracy by practicing with real words and sentences right in the command line interface (CLI). 

You do not need to install any complex software or have programming skills to use typer.

---

## 🖥️ Who Is This For?

typer is designed for anyone who wants to practice typing. It does not matter if you are using Windows, Linux, or macOS. If you know how to open a terminal or command prompt, you can use typer. It is great for:

- Students learning to type faster.
- Professionals wanting to improve typing speed.
- Anyone who prefers distraction-free practice in a terminal window.

---

## 🎯 Why Use typer Instead of Other Options?

Many typing practice tools require a web browser or complex setup. typer lives in your terminal, so it:

- Does not need internet after you download it.
- Works on most computers with Python installed.
- Offers a simple, clean interface without ads or clutter.
- Lets you focus on your typing without distractions.

It mimics the style of monkeytype—a popular online tool—but runs locally in your terminal.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before downloading, make sure your computer meets these basics:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.12 or later, or any Linux distribution.
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- A terminal or command prompt where you can run commands.
- No special hardware needed. A standard keyboard works fine.

If you are unsure about Python, don’t worry. The next section will guide you through downloading and running typer.
